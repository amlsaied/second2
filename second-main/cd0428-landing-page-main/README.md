# Interactive Landing Page Project

## Overview

This project is an interactive landing page designed to showcase skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike a static page, this landing page offers dynamic features that enhance user experience through interactivity.

## Project Features

- **Dynamic Navigation**: Navigation links that update based on the section currently in view.
- **Section Highlighting**: Each section changes color or styling when it appears in the viewport, allowing users to see which section they are viewing at a glance.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Smooth scrolling functionality for a seamless transition between sections when a navigation link is clicked.

## Getting Started

1. Open `js/app.js` to start building the JavaScript functionality for interactivity.
2. Customize the HTML and CSS files as needed to align with the design and interactivity goals of the project.
3. Integrate JavaScript to make the page responsive and engaging for users.

## Development Process

This project demonstrates how to make a static page interactive by:
- Setting up event listeners for scroll and navigation events.
- Utilizing `IntersectionObserver` to detect when sections enter the viewport and adjust styling accordingly.
- Implementing a smooth scrolling effect for intuitive navigation.

## Built With

-HTML5: For the page structure.
- CSS3: For styling and design, including transition effects.
- JavaScript: For dynamic content rendering and interactive features.

## Usage
